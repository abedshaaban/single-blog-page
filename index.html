          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            To learn how to speack Mandarin Chinese, first we need to learn how
            to spell and read Mandarin Chinese. To do so we will have to know
            <a href="#Pinyin">Pinyin</a>, so we can get to know the sound system
            in Chinese. Then recognize and memorize <a href="#Hanzi">Hanzi</a>,
            which is to practice the charecters that represent meaning.

            <h3 id="Pinyin">üåü Pinyin</h3>
            <br />
            <img
              src="./public/Chinese-pinyin-sounds.png"
              alt="Chinese pinyin sounds"
              class="img-style shadow" />
            <br />
            <p>
              Similar to the English Language, Mandarin Chinese has 26 letters
              in the Alphabet, and each one could be spelled in 4 different ways
              and all these 4 ways hold a different meaning. It could be hard at
              first to say the exact sound but you will get it right after some
              practice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's try and say "Hello". The word "Hello" in Mandarin Chinese
              consists of 3 syllables and 2 words "N«ê" and "h«éo". Both "N«ê h«éo"
              can be spelled as we say "knee" and "how" in English. Now try it
              with me "knee how". Amazing!!! You just said "N«ê h«éo" in Mandarin
              Chinese.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 id="Hanzi">üåü Hanzi</h3>
            <br />
            <img
              src="./public/ni-hao.jpg"
              alt="ni hao"
              class="img-style shadow" />
            <br />
            <p>
              Hanzi is the Chinese writing and charecters. Some of them is hard
              to draw while others are easy as a one small horizontal line which
              means number 1 in Mandarin Chinese. To continue on what have
              passed, "N«ê" can be drawn as " ‰Ω† " and "h«éo" as " Â•Ω ". Simple as
              easy
